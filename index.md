Hi! I am a PhD candidate at the Chair of Environmental Economics and Natural Resources of Wageningen University, The Netherlands. I study how people cope with climate risk. For example, in my dissertation I combine geospatial data with a web-based experiment to study how people react to information on flood risk at their address. My CV is [here](/CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### Working Papers

<b>Information frictions, overconfidence, and learning: Experimental evidence from a floodplain</b> \

<details><summary><abstract>Abstract</abstract></summary> I use an online experiment to study whether offering information to floodplain residents is sufficient to change their perceived risk exposure and demand for insurance. The participants are offered information on the flood risk profile at their address and on the rules over compensation of flood damages. I find that respondents tend to misperceive their risk category according to publicly available flood maps, but express high levels of confidence in their guesses. When not prompted to engage with the information they are offered, one third of them read nothing. Respondents who are asked to read information on their risk profile tend to stop reading any further and report a lower willingness-to-pay for insurance. However, this effect does not seem to be driven by respondents learning more from the information they are provided with, at least based on how they update their beliefs. Instead, I find suggestive evidence of backlash to information among residents of high risk areas and individuals who initially underestimated their risk category. </details>


### Selected Work in Progress

<b>Erratic adaptation to flood risk in information-rich, high-income communities</b> \
with [Anna Abatayo](https://annabatayo.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Andries Richter](https://andriesrichter.com/){:target="_blank"}
<details><summary><abstract>Abstract</abstract></summary>  More frequent and intensive flooding events require effective household adaptation measures. Here, we investigate how household adaptation measures relate to objective, expected household damages in the South of the Netherlands. By combining publicly available flood maps, a national hydraulic model, and a large-scale survey, our study reveals a mismatch in spatial patterns of flood risk and adaptation at the household level, emphasizing inequalities in both exposure and adaptation strategies. Further, the study explores the determinants of household adaptation, recognizing the potential amplification of climate-driven inequalities. </details>
